Java 2D Game Ideas

-Enemies 
-Moving Enemies
-Barriers
-Requirements to beat the level such as efficiency, move x number of times in y direction etc

-varying level shapes (non rectangular will be difficult)
-multiple levels
-bosses only defeat-able with a power that can be picked ups and only last a certain amount of turns
-efficient wins counter
-counting losses/game over function
-board is already larger but barriers make it a certain size (used to make board bigger while actually working)
